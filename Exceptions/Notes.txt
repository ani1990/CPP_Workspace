Exceptions
In C every call had to be checked for error values - which could double the code size. C++ exceptions are an alternative to traditional techniques when they are insufficient, inelegant, and error-prone. Three keywords are involved

try - specifies an area of code where exceptions will operate
catch - deals with the exceptional situation produced in the previous try clause.
throw - causes an exceptional situation
When an exception is 'thrown' it will be 'caught' by the local "catch" clause if one exists, otherwise it will be passed up through the call hierarchy until a suitable "catch" clause is found. The default response to an exception is to terminate.

There are many types of exception - they form a class hierarchy of their own. Here just a few will be introduced.

try {
// code
}
// catch a standard exception
catch(std::exception& e){
 // order of the catch clauses matters; they're tried 
 // in the given order
}
// catch all the other types
catch(...) {
// cleanup
   throw;   // throw the exception up the hierarchy
}

Here's an example that sooner or later will produce an exception.

try{
  for(;;)
    new char[10000];
}
catch(bad_alloc) {
  cerr << "No memory left";
}
"In general (very roughly) exceptions are best for errors that you really can't continue on very well - you might recover but there is not a good way to finish the task that was asked. You can bypass all functions along the way and go back to one (or a few) places where you handle all bad errors. This can really clean up your code by separating the algorithm logic from the error logic." - Jeff Connelly.

"Other than that, I use them depending on common use. If a function will usually succeed, I'll throw an exception when it fails. That way, all the client code doesn't have to keep looking at return codes and comparing them. If a failure needs to be propogated up and handled by something other than the original caller, I'll throw an exception. Otherwise, I use error codes."
